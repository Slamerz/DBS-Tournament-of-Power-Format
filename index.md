## Introduction

Tournament of Power is a singleton format for Dragon Ball Super Card Game that emphasizes strategic deck building around a Leader and their chosen Champion. With larger deck sizes and life totals, games are designed to be longer and more interactive, perfect for multiplayer settings.

## Deck Construction

- **Leader and Champion**: 
  - 1 Leader Card
  - 1 Champion Card (acts as your "Commander")
  - Champion can be any Battle Card

- **Deck Size**:
  - 99 card main deck (100 including Champion)
  - 10 card Z-Deck (maximum)

- **Color Restrictions**:
  - Your deck cannot include colors that are not present on your Leader or Champion
  - Example: If your Leader is Red and your Champion is Blue/Yellow, you can include Red, Blue, Yellow, and any combination of those colors in your deck

- **Singleton Rule**:
  - Only 1 copy of any card with the same card number allowed in your deck
  - Exception: Skills that modify deck building restrictions still apply
  - Example: You may include more than 1 copy of a [Dragon Ball] keyword card, or as many Saibamen cards as you'd like

- **Banned/Errata List**:
  - There is currently no Ban List.
  - All official Errata cards remain active

## Champion Rules

- **Champion Zone**:
  - Champion starts the game in the "Champion Zone"
  - This zone is not considered in play or in hand
  - It is an open area, and cards in the Champion Zone cannot be set to Rest Mode/Active Mode

- **Playing Your Champion**:
  - Champions can be played from the Champion Zone by paying the card's energy cost
  - The energy cost increases by 2 each time the Champion is returned to the Champion Zone

- **Counter Skills**:
  - Champion cards in the Champion Zone can activate [Counter] skills

- **Replacement Effects**:
  - When a Champion would move to an area other than a Battle Area or Combo Area, the owner may apply a replacement effect that places the card in the Champion Zone instead
  - Example: If the Champion card in the Battle Area would be placed on the bottom of your deck, you could place it in the Champion Zone instead

- **Returning Your Champion**:
  - If a Champion card is in an open area other than a Battle Area or Combo Area, the owner during their Main Phase may return the Champion card to the Champion Zone
  - Example: If the Champion card is in a player's Warp, or even removed from the game, the owner may place it back in their Champion Zone

## Skill Rules

- **"Opponent" References**:
  - When a skill references "opponent," it applies to all opponents in the game
  - Example: If a skill says "choose up to 2 of your opponent's Battle Cards," you could choose 2 cards from the same player, or 1 card from one opponent and 1 card from another opponent

- **Choice Skills**:
  - Skills like "then your opponent may" offer the choice to all opponents in turn order
  - Example: If playing in a 3-player game, and someone plays an [Offering] card, both opponents would have to decide to crit a life or not, and for each opponent who doesn't, the owner draws 2

- **Timing Resolution**:
  - Timing is done in turn order
  - When resolving skills in a Checkpoint, the turn player resolves all of their [Auto]s first, then the player who would go next, continuing until all players have resolved the checkpoint

- **Counter Windows**:
  - When an event with a [Counter] window occurs, any opponent can respond to the [Counter] window
  - The chance is offered in turn order
  - Only 1 [Counter] can respond to each [Counter] window
  - Example: In a 4-player game, if Player 1 attempts to play a card with a skill, this opens [Counter: Play] window 1. Player 2 may activate a [Counter: Play]; if they don't, Player 3 can. If Player 3 does, then [Counter: Play] window 1 has a counter and Player 4 cannot activate a [Counter: Play] in response to the original play event.

- **[Counter: Attack] Skills**:
  - [Counter: Attack] skills offer the [Counter] skill response to the target of the attack first, then goes in turn order until all other players not involved in the attack have decided
  - Example: In a 4-player game, if Player 1 declares an attack on Player 3, Player 3 may activate a [Counter: Attack] skill. If they choose not to, Player 4 is offered the [Counter: Attack], and if they don't, Player 1 is skipped (as they are the attacker), and then Player 2 is offered the [Counter: Attack]

## Game Setup

- **Starting the Game**:
  - Whoever rolls highest picks the player who goes first
  - Turns are taken clockwise in games with more than 2 players

- **First Player Advantages/Disadvantages**:
  - In a 2-player game:
    - Player 2 receives an energy marker
    - Player 1 does not draw on their first turn
  - In a 3+ player game:
    - Player 1 draws a card on their first turn and receives 1 energy marker
    - All other players receive 2 energy markers

- **First Turn Protection**:
  - Players may not attack another player who has not taken their first turn

## Multiplayer Rules

- **Turn Order**:
  - Play proceeds clockwise from the first player
  - Each player completes all phases of their turn before passing to the next player

- **Life Total**:
  - Players start the game with 16 life.

- **Eliminating Players**:
  - A player is eliminated as normal like their life reaching 0, or running out of cards in their deck.
  - When a player is eliminated, any skills or effects they control end immediately
